Step 1: Deciding (not) to Segment

Market segmentation has developed to be a key marketing strategy applied in many organizations; it is not always the best decision to pursue such a strategy. Deciding whether or not to segment a market is a strategic choice that depends on several factors.

•	If the organisations culture is market oriented, we can proceed with market segmentation, otherwise there is no need for it.

•	Market segmentation is a long-term strategy, so the organizations must be genuinely willing to change things and is open to new ideas.

•	Segmentation is beneficial when the market consists of customers with varying needs, preferences, and behaviours.

•	If the market is relatively uniform and customers have similar needs and preferences, segmentation may not provide significant benefits.

•	Segmenting the market and developing tailored strategies can be resource intensive and costly, so the organization must have sufficient financial resources to support a market segmentation strategy.

•	Small businesses or startups with limited resources may struggle to effectively segment and target multiple market segments.


Step 2: Specifying the Ideal Target Segment

Knock-Out Criteria

Knock-out criteria are used to determine if market segments resulting from the market segmentation analysis qualify to be assessed using segment attractiveness criteria

•	The segment must be homogeneous.

•	The segment must be distinct.

•	The segment must contain enough consumers to make it worthwhile to spend extra money on customising the marketing mix for them.

•	The segment must be matching the strengths of the organisation.

•	Members of the segment must be identifiable.

•	The segments must be reachable.


Attractiveness Criteria

Attractiveness criteria help you evaluate and prioritize market segments based on their potential value to your business.

•	Larger segments with high revenue potential are more attractive.

•	Segments with strong growth rates and alignment with emerging trends offer future opportunities.

•	High profit margins and long-term customer value make segments more desirable.

•	Less competitive segments with potential for significant market are favourable.


Step 3: Collecting data

Collecting data is a crucial step in understanding your market, identifying segments, and making informed business decisions.

•	Clearly outline the purpose of your data collection, such as understanding customer behaviour or identifying market trends.

•	Determine where you’ll get your data, using primary sources like surveys and interviews, or secondary sources like market reports.

•	Choose appropriate data collection methods based on your objectives, such as surveys for quantitative data or interviews for qualitative insights.

•	Focus on accuracy and reliability by using representative samples, validating data, and ensuring consistency.

•	Store data systematically for easy analysis, and use statistical tools to extract meaningful insights that align with your goals.

•	Use statistical tools and software to interpret the data, identify patterns, and derive insights.

•	Regularly evaluate your data collection process to improve accuracy and relevance for future efforts.


Step 5: Extracting Segments

Extracting segments in market segmentation involves identifying distinct groups within a market that share common characteristics.

•	Choose the basis for segmentation, such as demographics, psychographics, behaviours, or geography.

•	Gather relevant customer data and prepare it for analysis, ensuring it’s clean, accurate, and comprehensive.

•	Use statistical techniques like cluster analysis, regression, or decision trees to identify patterns and group similar customers.

•	Form distinct customer segments based on shared characteristics, ensuring that each segment is homogeneous within but different from others.

•	Evaluate the segments for practicality, ensuring they are sizable, accessible, and aligned with business goals.


Step 6: Profiling Segments

Profiling segments involves creating detailed descriptions of each market segment to better understand their characteristics and needs.

•	Start by identifying the distinct segments you’ve defined through segmentation analysis.

•	Gather additional data on each segment, focusing on characteristics such as demographics, psychographics, behaviours, and preferences.

•	Create comprehensive profiles for each segment, including key attributes like age, income, lifestyle, buying behaviour, and needs.

•	Examine the profiles to understand each segment’s unique characteristics and how they differ from other segments.

•	Highlight critical insights about each segment, such as their pain points, motivations, and preferred communication channels.

•	Use the profiles to develop targeted marketing strategies, including product offerings, messaging, and promotional tactics that resonate with each segment.
